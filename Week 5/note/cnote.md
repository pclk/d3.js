# Data Visualization Concepts and Principles

## Core Components

### Dashboard
- **Definition**: An interface that presents multiple visualizations of data simultaneously, allowing users to view different perspectives of the same dataset
- **Key Principle**: Multiple views of the same dataset provide users with different perspectives and insights

### SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- **Definition**: An XML-based vector image format used for rendering graphics that can be scaled without losing quality
- **Implementation Note**: SVG elements can be displayed using percentages, similar to div elements

### Data-binding
- **Definition**: The process of connecting data to visual elements in D3.js, allowing for synchronized updates between data and visualization
- **Best Practice**: Decoupling data preparation from drawing operations improves maintainability and performance

## Interactive Elements

### Brush Component
- **Definition**: A D3.js control that allows users to select a portion of data by clicking and dragging
- **Events**:
  - brushstart: Fired when mouse button is pressed down
  - brush: Fired continuously during dragging
  - brushend: Fired when mouse button is released
- **UI Consideration**: Requires additional UI elements to make it more user-friendly

### Cross-highlighting
- **Definition**: The technique of highlighting related elements across multiple visualizations when interacting with one element
- **Benefit**: Enhances understanding of relationships between different views of the same data

## Data Structure and Scaling

### d3.nest()
- **Definition**: A D3.js function that transforms flat data structures into hierarchical ones by grouping data based on specified keys

### Domain and Range
- **Domain**: The input values for a scale in D3.js
- **Range**: The output values for a scale in D3.js
- **Related Function**: rangeBands - Divides a given width into equal areas, commonly used for bar charts

## Visualization Types

### Circle Pack Chart
- **Definition**: A hierarchical visualization displaying nested circles, where larger circles contain smaller ones
- **Use Case**: Effective for showing hierarchical relationships, such as tweeters and their tweets

## Design Considerations

### Responsive Design
- **Definition**: The ability of visualizations to automatically resize and adjust based on screen size changes
- **Components**:
  - Viewport: The visible area of a web page on a display device
  - Canvas Size: The dimensions of the drawing area for visualizations

### Graphical Channels
- **Definition**: Visual properties of elements that can be manipulated
- **Examples**: Position, size, color, and opacity

## Performance and Implementation

### Event Handling
- **Definition**: Functions that wait for and respond to specific user interactions or system events
- **Best Practice**: Heavy computational operations should be separated from immediate visual feedback

### UI Elements
- **Modal Pop-up**: A dialog box or window that appears on top of the current page
- **Purpose**: Used to display additional information without leaving the current context
